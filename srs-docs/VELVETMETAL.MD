Velvet Metal Product Requirements Document (v1)

1. Executive Summary

Velvet Metal is a platform-agnostic music aggregator that unifies users‚Äô streaming accounts into one seamless interface. Designed to eliminate fragmentation, it allows listeners to explore, manage, and sync their music libraries‚Äîregardless of source. Think of it as mission control for your music universe: clean, cohesive, and made for people who value both simplicity and power. 2. Problem Statement
Today‚Äôs music ecosystem is splintered:
Multiple apps, fractured libraries: Listeners use Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music, but switching between them is painful.
Playlists don‚Äôt transfer well: Existing tools like Soundiiz are clunky, slow, or incomplete.
Discovery is siloed: Each service builds echo chambers; cross-platform discovery is rare.
Syncing lacks memory: Most tools don‚Äôt keep a reliable history of what was transferred, when, or why.
Velvet Metal solves this by giving users a unified experience for managing, syncing, and exploring music across services‚Äîno family therapy required. 3. Target Users
