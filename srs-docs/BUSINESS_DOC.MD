#### Company Profile

Sun Rot Studios is a Venice-based creative studio and cultural platform operating at the intersection of experimental software, live events, and independent artist amplification. Founded as both a technical laboratory and cultural engine, we build tools and experiences for creators who exist outside traditional industry frameworks.
Location: Venice, California
Founded: 2024
Classification: Creative Studio / Cultural Platform / Artist Collective

#### Mission Statement

Sun Rot Studios exists to build the tools and stages that the mainstream forgot. We create software, experiences, and platforms that serve independent artists—musicians, coders, designers, and cultural misfits—who operate beyond algorithmic discovery and corporate gatekeeping.
Our purpose is resonance over growth, moments over metrics, and meaningful connection over mass appeal.

#### Core Verticals

#### 1. Experimental Software (Rotware)

Custom-built applications and tools designed for creative communities:

- Beesides: Social platform for creative collaboration
- Velvet Metal: Digital experience platform
- Artist Portfolio Tools: Free web presence solutions for tattoo artists and visual creators
- Underground utilities: Niche tools serving specific creative subcultures

#### 2. Live Events (Heat Death Social Club)

Curated experiences that function as cultural rituals:

- Underground music showcases and raves
- Film screenings and visual art exhibitions
- Weekly salon gatherings for creative discourse
- Temporary autonomous zones designed for artistic connection

#### 3. Artist Platform (Peripheral Vision)

Decentralized label and curatorial arm:

- Music compilation releases
- Digital-first artist showcases
- Cross-disciplinary creative collaboration
- Independent artist amplification through integrated tools and events

#### Business Philosophy

We build with poetry and bugs. Our software development prioritizes aesthetic experience and cultural resonance alongside technical functionality.
We believe the underground should be loud. Our platform work focuses on amplifying voices that exist outside mainstream discovery mechanisms.
We don't scale. We resonate. Growth is measured by cultural impact and community depth rather than traditional metrics.
Community is creative technology. Our events and gathering spaces function as research and development labs for new forms of cultural expression.

#### Target Market

Primary: Independent creators, artists, and cultural workers who operate outside traditional industry structures

- Musicians without label representation
- Visual artists seeking alternative platforms
- Developers interested in creative applications
- Cultural workers building community-centered projects
  Secondary: Creative professionals seeking authentic alternatives to corporate platforms
  Tertiary: Cultural institutions and brands interested in genuine underground partnerships

#### Competitive Positioning

Sun Rot Studios occupies a unique position as a hybrid creative studio that develops both software and cultural experiences. Unlike traditional tech companies that appropriate creative aesthetics, or creative agencies that rely on existing platforms, we build integrated ecosystems where tools and community co-evolve.
Key Differentiators:

- Technical builds designed for specific creative subcultures
- Integration of software development with live cultural programming
- Anti-corporate ethos combined with professional execution
- Focus on long-term cultural impact over short-term metrics

#### Revenue Streams

Software Development: Custom applications and tools for creative communities
Event Production: Ticketed experiences and venue partnerships
Creative Services: Design and development work for aligned brands and artists
Platform Operations: Sustainable models for ongoing tool maintenance and community support

#### Strategic Partnerships

We collaborate with artists, venues, and cultural institutions that share our commitment to independent creative work and community-centered approaches. Partnership criteria emphasize cultural alignment over financial scale.

#### Brand Values

Authenticity over optimization. We build things that feel genuinely useful and culturally relevant rather than engagement-optimized.
Beauty over efficiency. Our tools and experiences prioritize aesthetic experience and emotional resonance.
Community over scale. We serve specific creative communities deeply rather than broad audiences superficially.
Experimentation over certainty. We ship imperfect, evolving projects that grow with their users.

#### Future Vision

Sun Rot Studios envisions a creative technology ecosystem where independent artists have access to tools and platforms designed specifically for their needs and values. We're building toward a cultural infrastructure that supports authentic creative work outside corporate frameworks.
Our growth strategy focuses on deepening our service to existing creative communities while expanding our technical capabilities and cultural programming. Success is measured by the vibrancy of the creative communities we serve and the cultural impact of the work we help facilitate.
Sun Rot Studios: Cultural tech for the beautifully unmarketable.
