Beesides Product Requirements Document (v1)

1. Executive Summary
   Beesides is a community-driven platform for album-focused music discovery, built on the belief that the best recommendations come from real people‚Äînot algorithms. By centering the experience around personal curation, rich user profiles, and social interaction, Beesides helps users build a meaningful relationship with music and each other.
2. Problem Statement
   Modern music platforms suffer from:
   Algorithmic echo chambers: Recommendations reinforce existing tastes rather than expanding them.
   Track-first bias: Albums are fragmented into playlists and singles.
   Weak community features: Listeners lack spaces to share, reflect, and recommend meaningfully.
   Poor music identity tools: Users can‚Äôt express their taste beyond simple likes or follows.
   Beesides solves this by making album discovery personal, expressive, and social.
