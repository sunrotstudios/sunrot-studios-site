# Sun Rot Studios - Website UI Style Guide

## Overview

The website should embody a **brutalist, minimalist, punk-inspired aesthetic**, strictly utilizing a monochromatic palette of black, white, and varying shades of gray. The site should feel irreverent, bold, and gritty, emphasizing raw visual impact over ornate decoration.

## Key Stylistic Attributes

- **Color Scheme**: Exclusively black, white, and gray. No color accents.
- **Typography**: Bold, aggressive typefaces that convey a punk and underground feel. Preferably sans-serif or heavy grotesque fonts.
- **Layout**: Sparse, spacious layouts with substantial negative space. Emphasize alignment grids but allow intentional disruption for visual interest.
- **Imagery**: High-contrast, monochrome photos and graphics with grain, noise, or distortion effects.
- **Interactivity**: Hover and click interactions should reinforce the brutalist ethos—sharp, abrupt animations rather than fluid or elegant movements.

## Animation and Transitions (GSAP)

Use **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** exclusively for animations and transitions. Animations should be:

- Smooth and beautiful, prioritizing fluid motion and elegant timing
- Graceful and refined while maintaining visual impact
- Incorporate subtle scale, skew, and opacity transitions for elements on scroll and hover states
- Use smooth "ease-out" and "ease-in-out" curves for natural, polished movements

### Recommended GSAP Techniques

- **ScrollTrigger** for impactful, high-contrast reveals on scroll
- **SplitText** for abrupt text reveals and dramatic transitions
- **Timeline animations** for sequences that emphasize disruptive visual storytelling

## UI Components and Elements

- **Buttons**: Solid blocks, minimal padding, heavy stroke outlines when necessary
- **Menus**: Overlay-based, stark contrasts, minimal visual clutter
- **Cards and Panels**: Flat, borderless or minimally bordered, with aggressive shadows or no shadows at all

## Examples of Desired Style

- High-contrast black/white brutalist websites
- Raw and deliberately "unfinished" visuals
- Punk zine aesthetics translated digitally

This guide outlines the exact visual direction for Claude, emphasizing that the implementation must prioritize the **brutalist spirit**, leveraging GSAP for impactful and intentionally stark animations.
