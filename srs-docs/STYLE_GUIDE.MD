Sun Rot Studios - Website UI Style Guide

Overview

The website should embody a brutalist, minimalist, punk-inspired aesthetic, strictly utilizing a monochromatic palette of black, white, and varying shades of gray. The site should feel irreverent, bold, and gritty, emphasizing raw visual impact over ornate decoration.

Key Stylistic Attributes
• Color Scheme: Exclusively black, white, and gray. No color accents.
• Typography: Bold, aggressive typefaces that convey a punk and underground feel. Preferably sans-serif or heavy grotesque fonts.
• Layout: Sparse, spacious layouts with substantial negative space. Emphasize alignment grids but allow intentional disruption for visual interest.
• Imagery: High-contrast, monochrome photos and graphics with grain, noise, or distortion effects.
• Interactivity: Hover and click interactions should reinforce the brutalist ethos—sharp, abrupt animations rather than fluid or elegant movements.

Animation and Transitions (GSAP)

Use GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) exclusively for animations and transitions. Animations should be:
• Quick and jarring to align with the brutalist aesthetic.
• Smooth in performance but stark and impactful visually.
• Incorporate subtle scale, skew, and opacity transitions for elements on scroll and hover states.
• Avoid fluid “ease-in” or overly graceful animations—aim for “ease-out” or linear curves to convey abruptness.

Recommended GSAP Techniques
• ScrollTrigger for impactful, high-contrast reveals on scroll.
• SplitText for abrupt text reveals and dramatic transitions.
• Timeline animations for sequences that emphasize disruptive visual storytelling.

UI Components and Elements
• Buttons: Solid blocks, minimal padding, heavy stroke outlines when necessary.
• Menus: Overlay-based, stark contrasts, minimal visual clutter.
• Cards and Panels: Flat, borderless or minimally bordered, with aggressive shadows or no shadows at all.

Examples of Desired Style
• High-contrast black/white brutalist websites.
• Raw and deliberately “unfinished” visuals.
• Punk zine aesthetics translated digitally.

This guide outlines the exact visual direction for Claude, emphasizing that the implementation must prioritize the brutalist spirit, leveraging GSAP for impactful and intentionally stark animations.
