# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Sun Rot Studios website codebase.

## Project Overview

**Sun Rot Studios** is a Venice-based creative studio operating at the intersection of experimental software, live events, and independent artist amplification. The official website showcases three core verticals:

- **üîß Rotware**: Experimental software and custom-built tools for creative communities
- **üé™ Heat Death Social Club**: Curated cultural experiences and underground showcases  
- **üëÅÔ∏è Peripheral Vision**: Decentralized label and curatorial arm for independent creators

**Cultural Mission**: "Cultural tech for the beautifully unmarketable" - building tools and stages for independent artists who operate beyond algorithmic discovery and corporate gatekeeping.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
tsc && vite build

# Type check without emitting
npm run type-check

### Routing Architecture
The app uses React Router DOM 7 with a simple flat route structure:
- `/` - Home view (landing experience with animated navigation)
- `/about` - About view (studio mission and philosophy)
- `/events` - Events view (Heat Death Social Club event listings)
- `/rotware` - Rotware view (experimental software showcase with scroll-driven gallery)
- `/peripheral-vision` - Peripheral Vision view (artist platform and music releases)

All routes are defined in `src/App.tsx` and render full-page view components wrapped in `TransitionProvider` for seamless page transitions.

## Design Philosophy

This project follows a **brutalist minimalist aesthetic** inspired by punk culture and underground movements:

### Visual Design System
- **Colors**: Exclusively black, white, and gray monochromatic palette
- **Typography**: Bold, aggressive typefaces conveying underground feel with generous spacing
- **Layout**: Sparse layouts with substantial negative space and airy, uncluttered feel
- **UI Elements**: Clean rectangles, generous padding, subtle shadows and borders
- **Interactivity**: Clean, impactful hover and click interactions

### Animation Principles
- **Performance**: Smooth and beautiful GSAP transitions prioritizing fluid motion
- **Timing**: Slow, serene transitions (0.8s ease-out) reinforcing calm, focused experience
- **Easing**: `power2.out/inOut` easing for page transitions, `ease-out` for content animations
- **Philosophy**: Prioritize aesthetic experience and emotional resonance over pure efficiency

## Core Components & Patterns

### TransitionContext
`src/contexts/TransitionContext.tsx` - Core transition system for page navigation:
- Corner-based page scaling animations using GSAP
- Manages `isTransitioning` state to prevent navigation conflicts
- `transitionToPage(path, corner)` function for programmatic navigation
- Uses `data-page` attribute to target page elements for animations

### Navigation Component
`src/components/ui/Navigation.tsx` - Context-aware navigation system:
- **Home Page**: Shows "EVENTS" in top-left corner (not "HOME")
- **Other Pages**: Current page's navigation button is hidden from corners
- **Corner Positioning**: EVENTS (top-left), ABOUT (top-right), ROTWARE (bottom-left), PERIPHERAL VISION (bottom-right)
- Integrates with TransitionContext for smooth page transitions
- Disabled state during transitions to prevent user conflicts

### Animation Hooks
- `useContentAnimations` - Staggered element reveal animations
- `useTimeDecay` - Progressive visual degradation effects
- All hooks use GSAP timelines with proper cleanup on unmount

### UI Components
- **GifChaosGrid** - Dynamic media display grid
- **EventCard** - Event information display for Heat Death Social Club
- **ProjectPanel** - Software project showcase panels for Rotware
- **CircularGallery** - Feature-specific gallery component

## Animation Guidelines

### GSAP Implementation
- Use **GSAP with ScrollTrigger** for scroll-driven experiences and page transitions
- All page components must include `data-page` attribute for transition targeting
- Use timeline-based animations with proper cleanup on component unmount
- Corner-based page scaling with `power2.out/inOut` easing

### Animation Standards
- **Timing**: 0.8s ease-out curves (brutalist minimalist principle)
- **Movement**: Prefer smooth, graceful movements that reinforce calm experience
- **Reveals**: Content slides up 30px and fades in
- **Hovers**: Subtle scale transforms (1.02) and animated underlines
- **Staggering**: Use staggered animations for multiple elements

### Text Animations
Available in `src/TextAnimations/`:
- **GlitchText** - Digital glitch effects
- **DecryptedText** - Matrix-style character reveals
- **Scrambled Text** - Random character scrambling

### Background Effects
Available in `src/Backgrounds/`:
- **Waves** - Fluid wave animations
- **Noise** - Texture overlay effects

## ROTWARE Page Specifications

ROTWARE is a **scroll-driven gallery** showcasing experimental software projects:

### Layout Structure
- **Initial View**: Clean white page with centered title block
  - Title: "ROTWARE" in heavy uppercase font
  - Subtitle: Single sentence in lighter weight font
  - Ample whitespace surrounding the block
- **Project Panels**: Stacked vertical panels, each consuming 80-90% of viewport height
- **Two-Column Grid**: Alternating layout for visual rhythm:
  - Panel 1: Text content left, media right
  - Panel 2: Media left, text content right
  - Panel 3: Text left, media right (pattern repeats)

### Project Panel Components
- **Project Title**: Large, bold, black, uppercase text (most dominant element)
- **Description**: Short paragraph (2-3 lines) in standard sans-serif font
- **Status Tag**: Small pill-shaped tag (e.g., "STATUS: IN DEVELOPMENT")
- **Media Container**: Clean rectangle with 1px black border or subtle shadow
- **"More Info" Expander**: Small clickable element with + icon and "DETAILS" text

### GSAP ScrollTrigger Implementation
- **Panel Pinning**: Each panel pins to viewport when it becomes focus
- **Smooth Transitions**: After scrolling viewport height, panel unpins and next slides up
- **Content Reveal**: Title/description slide up 30px and fade in (0.8s ease-out)
- **Media Animation**: Media container fades in after text content
- **Hover Effects**: Media scale(1.02), title gets animated underline left-to-right
- **Background Animations**: Unique looping animations per panel when pinned

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Two-column alternating layout is prominent
- **Mobile**: Single-column stack (title ‚Üí description ‚Üí status ‚Üí media)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with proper type definitions
- **Path Aliasing**: Use `@/` alias for src directory imports (configured in `vite.config.ts`)
- **ESLint**: Flat config with React hooks and refresh plugins
- **Component Structure**: Follow React 19 patterns with proper hooks usage

### Cultural Development Philosophy
- **Authenticity over optimization** - Build genuinely useful and culturally relevant features
- **Beauty over efficiency** - Prioritize aesthetic experience and emotional resonance
- **Community over scale** - Serve specific creative communities deeply
- **Experimentation over certainty** - Ship imperfect, evolving projects

### Important Conventions
- All page view components must include `data-page` attribute for transitions
- Use `useTransition()` hook for programmatic navigation with corner-based animations  
- Navigation state management through TransitionContext prevents conflicting animations
- Media assets should be optimized and lazy-loaded for performance
- Follow brutalist minimalist design principles in all new components

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for navigation flow
- Visual regression testing for animations
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device testing
- Lighthouse audits for performance

### Quality Checks
Always run these commands before committing:
```bash
npm run type-check  # TypeScript compilation check
npm run lint        # ESLint code quality check
```
