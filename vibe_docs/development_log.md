### 2025-06-05 - SRS Docs Review & Style Guide Analysis
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: Read srs-docs files to understand true aesthetic and page structure
**Reason**: User corrected page structure and referenced style guide documentation
**Impact**: 
- CRITICAL: Style guide calls for brutalist, monochromatic (black/white/gray) aesthetic
- Current pages use warm gradient backgrounds - CONFLICTS with style guide
- Need to build: /events, /about, /rotware, /peripheral-vision
- Animation should use GSAP (not Framer Motion) for jarring, brutalist feel
- Business verticals: Rotware (software), Heat Death Social Club (events), Peripheral Vision (label)
**Next**: Decide whether to update existing pages to match style guide or maintain current aesthetic

### 2025-06-05 - Complete Site Rebuild with Brutalist Aesthetic
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: Built all new pages from scratch following brutalist style guide
**Reason**: User requested new pages with white background and brutalist aesthetic
**Impact**: 
- Archived old pages to src/components/views/archive/
- Installed GSAP for jarring, brutalist animations
- Created 4 new pages: Home, About, Events, Rotware, PeripheralVision
- All pages follow monochromatic (black/white/gray) aesthetic
- Implemented proper routing for all new pages
- TypeScript compilation successful
**Next**: Test the new site in development server

### 2025-06-05 - Bold Orange Aesthetic Update Based on Image Inspiration
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: Updated site aesthetic from white brutalist to vibrant orange/red based on user's image reference
**Reason**: User provided image showing bold orange background with massive black typography and pill-shaped buttons
**Impact**: 
- Changed all page backgrounds from white to orange-500 (vibrant orange)
- Updated typography to massive, skewed text (inspired by "BREAKING BREAD WITH BRANDS")
- Changed navigation to white pill-shaped buttons with black borders
- Home page title changed to "CULTURAL REBELLION" with dramatic skew transforms
- About page header changed to "BREAKING BREAD WITH CULTURE"
- Much more aggressive, punk energy matching the reference image
**Next**: Complete updates to remaining pages (Rotware, PeripheralVision) and test

### 2025-06-05 - Complete Redesign to Swiss-Style Layout
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: Completely rebuilt site to match user's Swiss-style design reference

**Impact**: 
- Implemented horizontal lined background pattern using CSS gradients
- Created color-blocked header sections (blue, green, pink sections)
- Added structured sidebar navigation with colored tabs
- Used clean typography and Swiss-style grid layout
- Removed GSAP animations in favor of clean, static design
- Built responsive layout with proper content organization
- Home and About pages completed in new style
**Next**: Build remaining pages (Events, Rotware, PeripheralVision) in same Swiss style

### 2025-06-05 - Browser Tools Analysis Attempt
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT
**Changed**: Attempted to analyze https://monochrome.red/ using browser tools MCP
**Reason**: User asked to use browser tools to analyze site styling for copying design patterns
**Impact**: 
- Site https://monochrome.red/ is currently unreachable (ERR_SOCKET_NOT_CONNECTED)
- Browser tools MCP is functional and ready for use on accessible sites
- Demonstrated capability: puppeteer navigation, screenshot capture, and style analysis
**Next**: User can provide alternative site URL or continue with current Swiss-style design
