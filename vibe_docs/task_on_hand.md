# üéØ Current Task: Understanding Project Requirements

_Started: [Date]_
_Status: üîÑ DEVELOPMENT PHASE - Building Navigation & Pages_

## üìã PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

### Project Name

Sun Rot Studios Website

### Project Description

Creative studio website for Venice-based Sun Rot Studios - operating at intersection of software, subculture, and spectacle. Features experimental web apps, surreal events, underground radio, artist collaborations, and anti-corporate design.

### Target Users

- Art/design enthusiasts interested in experimental digital work
- Potential collaborators and clients
- Underground culture community
- People seeking non-corporate creative experiences

### Success Criteria

- Build out navigation and page display/rendering system
- Create functional pages for all navigation elements
- Maintain Sun Rot Studios aesthetic: fever dream transmissions
- Ensure smooth routing between all pages

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite (CONFIRMED)
- **Backend**: Static site (no backend needed currently)
- **Database**: None (static site)
- **Other Tools**: Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS v4, React Router, custom fonts

### Constraints

- **Timeline**: [Any deadlines?]
- **Budget**: [Resource constraints?]
- **Platform**: [Web, mobile, desktop, all?]
- **Performance**: [Speed, scale requirements?]

### Development Environment

- **OS**: macOS (confirmed)
- **Existing Tools**: Node.js, npm, Git, project already initialized
- **Current Status**: Environment setup complete, dependencies installed

## ‚ùì OPEN QUESTIONS

### High Priority Questions (Need immediate answers)

1. What is the main problem this project aims to solve?
2. Who are the primary users and what are their key needs?
3. What does success look like for this project?
4. Are there any hard technical requirements or constraints?
5. What is the expected timeline for completion?

### Technical Questions (Need answers before starting)

1. Do you have preferences for programming languages?
2. Do you have preferences for frameworks or libraries?
3. Will this need to integrate with existing systems?
4. What are the deployment requirements?
5. Are there specific security or compliance needs?

### Design Questions (Can be refined later)

1. Do you have design mockups or wireframes?
2. Are there branding guidelines to follow?
3. What is the desired user experience?
4. Mobile-first, desktop-first, or responsive?
5. Accessibility requirements?

## üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Discovery (Completed)

- [x] Gather all project requirements
